# US Fencing Population Study

This project served as a fun little activity to practice data analysis and see the patterns in the US Fencing membership. This readme will be updated with interesting findings.

Some obvious short-comings of this analysis are:

1. The data comes from querying AskFred, a popular tournament hosting site, so is not entirely reflective of the entire US Fencing population as a whole. However, this was the most accessible way to get data on a large proportion of the population.

2. The data is incomplete due to search querying errors, restriction to senior/open events, and parsing errors.

3. Because results are heavily linked to hosted tournaments, from 2020 on, results will be skewed due to lack of tournaments because of pandemic restrictions.
